# 🌬️ Wind Power Generation Forecasting– Week 2 Report

## 📅 Internship Progress: Week 2

This week focused on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to gain deeper insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between various meteorological features and wind power output.

## 📊 Visualizations

To better visualize trends and correlations, the following plots were created:

### 1. 🔵 Scatter Plots
- Purpose: To observe the relationship between **power output** and features like:
  - `temperature_2m`
  - `windspeed_100m`
  - `winddirection_10m`, etc.
- Insight: Helped identify patterns and potential linear/nonlinear relationships.

### 2. 📉 Histograms
- Purpose: To analyze the **distribution** of individual numerical variables.
- Insight: Allowed us to detect skewness, outliers, and the spread of the data.

### 3. 🔗 Correlation Heatmap
- Purpose: To measure the **correlation** between all numerical variables.
- Insight: Highlighted which features had the strongest linear relationships with `Power`.

### 4. 🧠 Hebbian Plot
- Purpose: To visualize potential associations between input variables and output using **neuro-inspired representations**.
- Insight: Provided a unique perspective on how input features might influence power generation.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Features such as **windspeed** and **temperature** show significant impact on power output.
- Several features exhibit multicollinearity, which may be important for feature selection in modeling.
- Hebbian visualizations introduced an alternative method of interpreting feature importance.
